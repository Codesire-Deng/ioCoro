# Distributed Algorithms Implementation With ioCoro
Here, I want to start a new journey with [ioCoro](https://github.com/wythers/ioCoro), implement distributed algorithms for Message-Passing Distributed Systems from simple to complex, and gradually improve [ioCoro](https://github.com/wythers/ioCoro) to achieve the ultimate goal of [ioCoro](https://github.com/wythers/ioCoro):  **Born For Distribution.**  
  
## Dependency
the [google::protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) is required, if you are a ubuntu user, can get it like:
```shell
$ sudo apt install protobuf-compiler
```
